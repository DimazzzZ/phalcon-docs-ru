Class **Phalcon\\DI\\FactoryDefault**
=====================================

*extends* :doc:`Phalcon\\DI <Phalcon_DI>`

This is a variant of the standard Phalcon\\DI. By default it automatically registers all the services provided by the framework. Thanks to this, the developer does not need to register each service individually.
