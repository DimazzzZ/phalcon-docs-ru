Class **Phalcon\\Mvc\\Micro**
=============================

*extends* :doc:`Phalcon\\DI\\Injectable <Phalcon_DI_Injectable>`

With Phalcon you can create "Micro-Framework like" applications. By doing this, you only need to write a minimal amount of code to create a PHP application. Micro applications are suitable to small applications, APIs and prototypes in a practical way.
